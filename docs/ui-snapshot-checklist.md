# UI Snapshot Checklist

- [x] Idle (no tracks): fixed two-column layout, status shows `Ready`, progress bar visible at `0%`.
- [x] Tracks loaded (before export): right panel width remains stable; only tracks list scrolls.
- [x] Export running: status and progress stay visible inside the window with smooth overall updates.
