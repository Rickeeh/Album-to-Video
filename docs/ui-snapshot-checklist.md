# UI Snapshot Checklist

- Presets and inputs keep their baseline sizing (no stretched or full-width regressions).
- Toggling `Create release folder` does not change vertical layout height.
- Global page does not scroll; only the tracks list scrolls.
- Progress bar is clearly visible as a bar and not a thin line.
- Progress updates stay smooth and monotonic during render.
